Description : This program is aimed at people using a Raspberry Pi, equipped with a sense hat, for the first time (like for the Astro Pi project). The program provides feedback on what is happening to the Raspberry Pi (USB insertion/removal, overheating, too much humidity, too much shaking...) in order to better inform the users about the state of the equipment.
